# Oober
### A React Native Uber Client

Built with Expo, you can simulate Uber trips and view your Uber account data. The app uses the Uber API to retrieve 
real Uber product and price data, and uses the Google Maps Directions API to highlight driver routes. The Uber API also 
simulates a real Uber trip by generating a driver and moving their coordinates to your pickup location, then once you are "in"
the car it moves towards the destination specified either through placing a map marker or typing in an address.
